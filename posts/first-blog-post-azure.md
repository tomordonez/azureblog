I have been working with Azure for the last few weeks:

* Created a Windows VM in Azure to run PowerBI.
* Created an Azure SQL Server/Database that I use with PowerBI to create reports.
* Created an Azure Static Web App using Next.js/React (this blog)

I am pursuing the `PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst` certification and other Azure certs. I will be posting content about it here.
